## Joshua Tobin

Over 20+ years experience leading high-impact engineering initiatives. Goal-focused leader with a diverse background in cloud native infrastructure, distributed systems and high-availability production environments. I've had success working at small start-ups in addition to navigating large 50k+ people organizations. I have a knack for understanding cross-organizational deficiencies and solving problems through precise communication, efficient planning and execution. I prefer working on a team of highly motivated peers verses being in a silo as a service role.
